# Git Push Instructions

## Steps to push to GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it: `panimalar-placement-portal`
   - Keep it public or private as per your preference
   - DON'T initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **After creating the repository, run these commands:**

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/panimalar-placement-portal.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative if you want to use SSH:

```bash
# For SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/panimalar-placement-portal.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
